While determinants define conditions based on field values (e.g., 'if field X equals Y'), Effects define what happens to a component when those conditions are met. Effects provide more granular control over component behavior than the basic determinant show/hide mechanism described in the Determinants section.</p> <p>Effects work through a layered structure: - A form component can have a 'component behaviour' attached to it. - Each component behaviour can contain one or more 'effects'. - Each effect links one or more determinants to the component and specifies what should happen when the determinant conditions are met.</p> <p>This service has 64 component behaviours defined across its forms. Nearly every one of these behaviours carries exactly 1 effect (effect_count: 1), demonstrating that the typical pattern is a one-to-one mapping between a behaviour and its effect. One behaviour has 0 effects, indicating a behaviour record can exist as a placeholder before an effect is attached.

Select the effect type (activate, deactivate, show, hide, enable, or disable). The default is 'activate'. 5. Set the effect value (true or false). The default is true. 6. Save the effect.</p> <p>When an effect is created, the system generates a behaviour record for the component (if one does not already exist) and attaches the effect to it.

For example, you could create an effect that shows a field only when both the applicant type is 'company' AND the registration type is 'new registration' (AND logic), or create an effect that disables a field when either the application is in 'draft' status OR the user has selected 'not applicable' (OR logic).</p> <p>Consider the component <code>datosComplementariosContinuar</code>.
