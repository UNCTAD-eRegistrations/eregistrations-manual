Nearly every one of these behaviours carries exactly 1 effect (effect_count: 1), demonstrating that the typical pattern is a one-to-one mapping between a behaviour and its effect.

This is the default. - OR logic: The effect triggers if any one of the referenced determinants has its condition met.</p> <p>This allows for complex conditional behaviors. For example, you could create an effect that shows a field only when both the applicant type is 'company' AND the registration type is 'new registration' (AND logic), or create an effect that disables a field when either the application is in 'draft' status OR the user has selected 'not applicable' (OR logic).</p> <p>How this works in practice \u2014 \"Permisos eventuales\": Consider the component <code>datosComplementariosContinuar</code>.
