Introduction
The purpose of this user manual is to provide an overview of the main functions and
features of the eRegistrations system and to explain how to create online services.

Description of eRegistrations
●​ eRegistrations is a no-code development platform allowing to create online
services without programming.
●​ An online service is a succession of online screens and actions through which:
○​ an applicant can fill a form, upload documents, pay and send his request
(application file)
○​ one or more operators can review the file and approve or reject an application
(processing)
○​ The applicant data is sent to an online registry
○​ A registration certificate is issued
●​ Online services are visible on the “public site”, also called “user site” or “DS”
(Display System)
●​ They are created through an “administrative site”, also called “BPA” (Business
Process Analyzer)

I. ADMINISTRATIVE SITE
Video tutorial - Entry page overview

The administrative site, also called BPA (Business Process Analyzer) is the
site where online services are created. The BPA requires no programming.
Services are built by configuring a succession of screens.

A.Description of the entry page
This is what you see when you first enter the BPA

The BPA entry page has 3 main sections
●​ “Header” also called “instance bar” (the blue bar at the top)
●​ Side menu (on the left)
●​ Work space (in grey)

1 The header or “instance bar”

It consists sequentially of:

UNCTAD and eRegistrations logo
You see 3 buttons FE (front end), BE (back end) and DS (display system).
When they are red, it means the corresponding component (FE, BE and
DS are components of eRegistrations) is getting updated. We can work on
the system only when all buttons are green.
When you put the cursor over the components name (FE, BE or DS) you
will see the version number currently running in the instance. Versioning is
made according to semantic versioning rules.
‘Logged users’ show the number of administrators logged into BPA at that
moment.
When the toggle is switched on, new feature/bug fixes are allowed to come
automatically to the applications in the system

D. Application file
Video tutorial - overview of application file and the guide page.

●​ It is composed of pages/screens through which the applicant will provide the required
data, the documents and the fees.
●​ In general, the application file is composed of the following pages:
○​ Guide: a page where the applicant has to answer questions that will allow the system to
determine the registrations s/he needs to apply for and, according to the registrations
selected, the required data, documents and fees.
○​ Form: to enter the required data
○​ Documents upload: to upload the required document
○​ Payment: a page explaining how and when the required fees can be made, or allowing
to pay online
○​ Send: a page giving details about the processing of the file once submitted by the
applicant
●​ A very important notion, called “determinant” is also explained. Determinants allow us to
take into account the specific case of each applicant and, in particular, to generate an
adapted applicant file format for each user.

To create a question in the
Guide, → click on the ‘Guide’ tab
in the Application File → under
the ‘Form’ tab, create questions
using the form components that
will filter the data, requirements
and fees for specific users’ case

Alternative to the guide: the shopping cart

2. Take into account each user case: create and use determinants
A determinant is a filter allowing to take into account the particular case of each applicant
in a service. It determines/triggers:
●​ If an applicant is subject to a registration and/or
●​ What requirements the applicant must provide to register (data, documents,
fees).
2.1. Determinants of the registration
Video tutorial - determinants in guide and registration
For each registration, an analyst must be able to report/input in the rule engine, in clear language,
rules defining who/what are the subjects of the registration.
To this end, the analyst can select one or various of the following options:
1)​ The registration is mandatory to all
2)​ The registration is mandatory to specific subjects
3)​ The registration is optional to all

4)​ The registration is optional to specific subjects
1 and 2 can’t be selected simultaneously; 3 and 4 can’t be selected simultaneously.
Specific subjects (in 2 and 4) can be defined through determinants or a combination of
determinants. Determinants can be combined by “AND” and “OR” operators. Combinations can
be grouped into “groups of determinants”. Group of determinants can be combined through “AND”
and “OR” operators.
Examples:
a)​ Registration is mandatory for attribute “resident” (all residents must register)
b)​ Registration is mandatory for attribute “resident” AND attribute “foreigner” (all residents
who are foreigners must register)
c)​ Registration is mandatory for {attribute “resident”} AND {attribute “foreigner” OR attribute
“have children”} (all foreign resident must register; national residents who have children
must register)

2.2. Determinants of the requirements
Determinants play a very important role in the application file. They allow to show or hide
specific parts of the application form to adapt the form to the particular situation of each
applicant. For example, if an applicant selects “Cooperative” under business ownership,
the determinant will be created and applied to show only the cooperative details in the
application form. This example is presented below visually.
Determinants can be created on the basis of fields/questions in the Guide or in the form
and can be applied to any field/ block.
The easiest, to create a determinant, is to start on the block or field where you want to
apply this determinant.

to copy the value → Save
The order of elements on the
drop down list for “Copy value
from” is - Name of the page,
Block and Field

copy value setting, it will be
indicated by the letter ‘C’ in blue
color.
CVF works only between fields of
the same type (from text field to
text field, number field to number
field, date to date, etc.

b. Copy edit grid values to
another edit grid using
copy value from.
To set it up we need two edit
grids - source and destination.
In the destination edit grid we
need to specify from which edit
grid the data will be copied.
Open edit window on destination
edit grid, go to “Copy value from
tab”, select the source edit grid in
the respective field and click
save.

Below you will find a list of functions with
explanation:
maxValue - to be set on a number type field. It takes other
number type fields and compares their values. The result is the
highest number appearing in any of the examined fields.

round - to be set on a number type field. It takes other number
type fields and rounds the result of any mathematical operation
occurring between them. It will return the nearest whole
number to the result. If result is 0.4 it will round down and will
return 0 if it’s 0.5 it will round up and return 1
Ceil - same as round only it always rounds the result up.

Floor - same as round only it always rounds the result down.

Roundup hundred - to be set on a number type field. It takes
other number type fields. It divides the result by 100 and
rounds it up. If the result is 50 this action will return 1. If the
result is 101 it will return 2
There are also two similar functions:: roundup thousands and
roundup hundred thousands. They apply to a different order of
magnitude of the numbers but the principal is the same.
Subtract days - to be set on a date/time type field. It takes
another date/time type field and a number field and subtracts
the number of days provided in the number field from the date
field.
If there is a need to operate on months or years there are two
similar functions for that:
Subtract months and subtract years

Add days. It’s the same as subtract days, only the number of
days is added to the date field.
If there is a need to operate on months or years there are two
similar functions for that:
Add month and add years
Override year - to be set on a date/time type field. It takes other
date/time type field and a number field and replaces year value
from the date field with the one given in number field.

Override date - to be set on a date/time type field. The
overrideDate function allows you to modify specific components
of a given date, such as year, month, day, hour, and minute. It
takes six parameters: date, year, month, day, hour, and minute.
Parameters:

●​
●​
●​

●​
●​
●​

date (required): Date object.
year (optional): The new year value to override the input

date's year. If set to 0, the year will not be changed.
month (optional): The new month value (1-12) to override
the input date's month. If set to 0, the month will not be
changed.
day (optional): The new day value to override the input
date's day. If set to 0, the day will not be changed.
hour (optional): The new hour value (0-23) to override the
input date's hour.
minute (optional): The new minute value (0-59) to
override the input date's minute.

Example:
If we want to have a field that will always show the last day of
the current year, we would have to take a date field in which we
would have for example date that the file was submitted and we
would
apply
this
formula
to
the
date
field.

The value from the date field is copied onto our field with
formula. The year is not changed as the first parameter is 0.
Month is set to 12 and day is set to 31.

Field with this formula is placed in first grid and checks grid
with comapnies which already have lien on them. Grid
isnamed “Grid liens on person”. From this grid we want the
name of the company “Company name” and we filter by
Registration number in both grids. So As a result if the
registration number is the same in both grids the company
name will be copied to the first grid. This way we can have the
indoermation that there is already a lien on the company we
selected to put a lien on.

When the document is uploaded,
the data extractor lists the data
available for extraction:

At this point the analyst can
decide if a given field is needed
for validation, meaning if the field
is not found after uploading a file
in DS the upload component
should return validation error.
He can also decide which data
should be included in service
data meaning, a value will be
created in SFL so that it can be
used in copy value from.

Next the analyst needs to link this
document somewhere on the
form and prepare fields which will

8. Custom classes
Custom class
Video tutorial - Applying custom classes with two examples. (datagrid footer and field + button)
Custom class is a feature that can be applied to the fields in the forms. It is used for customizing fields (in
terms of spacing, alignment, color, size, etc.) or to deploy a function to a particular field. Depending on the
type of fields, different options to customize will be available for selection.
Description of each type of custom class is provided below:

To add a custom class open edit modal of a
particular field. For some fields the
advanced toggle needs to be switched on
for select custom class field to appear.

background color to the color you have selected.

IMPORTANT NOTE!
Background color is inherited. If background
color is set on a block which has a sub

Top space

It adds a space on the top of the component (the default space
that separates components) To be used in the cases where the
component is the first inside a column or table cell and the space
is removed by default to avoid double spacing (e.g. table space
+ field space). This will intentionally add the removed space.

Top space (2X)

To add double of the default component separator space

Top space (3X)

To add triple of the default component separator space

Remove top inner space

Removes the space between the end of the component label
and the beginning of the radio + label value.

Vertical align top/ center/ bottom

When added to columns, the content within each column will
tend to align vertically dependent on the class used. When
applied to a field within a datagrid, it will align vertically the field
according to the current row

Full height

When added it gives the component the height of 100% which
means the component will try to occupy 100% of the available
height of its parent. Can be added to any component

●​ Payment form component
●​ I-swear component

Payment form component

This class should be added by default to Payment Page related blocks and
is here only to be used in the case that it was not added by default by the

I-swear component

To be added to I swear component in BPA for proper styling

E. BOT builder
A BOT is an automated action performed by the system. There are two types of BOTs:
●​ data BOT, to exchange data between an eRegistration service and an external system (eg a GDB
database)
●​ document BOT, to display a document on the screen (e.g. a license, or a certificate) or upload it to the
user file.

2. Mapping
Mapping or data mapping is the process of matching fields from one database to another. This feature
enables the transfer of data between the eRegistrations system and the GDB system. And this task is
performed by data BOTs.
Mapping data in internal BOTs allows the user to transfer the data between different forms within the same
service. It does not require sending the data to external database

In mapping with transformation
applied the circle will have violet
color. If there is no transformation
applied, the circle will remain
white.

1.Mapping transformations list
Following table explains all mapping transformations behavior.

Equals value without
case-sensitive

Transformation will check for a text string value in the database, but will
accept both capital and lower-case letters in regard to every letter of the
queried string. Example: User is querying the database for “kings french fries”
while in the database the corresponding value is “KINGS French fries”.
With “Equals value without case-sensitive transformation” applied the BOT will
give a positive result although both values are not exactly the same.

Not equals value

Transformation will return all values that are different from the value queried.It
is case-sensitive

Not equals value without
case-sensitive

This transformation is to be used on text fields due to case sensitivity check. It
will return all values that are different from the value queried regardless of how
the value was saved in the database (with capital letters, lower-case letter, or
mix of both)

Contains value

Transformation will return all values that contain the queried data. Example: if
the query value would be “kin” the database of english dictionary would return
values like - Skin, king, baking, striking, electrokinetics

Contains value without
case-sensitive

It is the same as Contains value, only it does not distinguish the letters size.
Example: if the query value would be “kin” in this case it would additionally
return words like King, Kinetic etc.

Not contains value

Transformation will return all values that do not contain the queried value. It is
case-sensitive

Not contains value without
case-sensitive

Transformation will return all values that do not contain the queried value. It is
not case-sensitive

Less than value

Transformation will return all values that are less than the queried value. It
applies for example to number and date type fields

Less or equal than value

Transformation will return all values that are less or equal to the queried
value. It applies for example to number and date type fields

IN

IN transformation is used to query for a value within a list of values in a
database.

Greater than value

Transformation will return all values that are greater than the queried value. It
applies for example to number and date type fields

Greater or equal than value

Transformation will return all values that are greater or equal to the queried
value. It applies for example to number and date type fields

Starts with

Transformation will return all values that start with the queried value.Example:
If the query value would be “Kin” in english dictionary database then the
query would return words like King, Kinetic etc, but words like Skin,, baking,
striking, electrokinetics would not be returned for the query.

Similarity

With this transformation we are able to search the DB for all words in the
query in any order they will occur.
We can also sort the results of this action to put the most matching ones in
the top of the response. To do that additional parameter has to be provided
with the query which needs to be linked to the ordering field in the BOT.

The ordering value that needs to be pasted depends on the structure in DB
for which we are querying the value.
In this case we are querying for Name column which is inside Name block

So the ordering parameter value in this case will be
“Name.Name__similarity”

Fuzzy and fuzzy with
precision class1…8

With the “Fuzzy” transformation we are able to search the DB for a value that
is not exactly the same as the query value. The list of available fuzzy
transformations in as follows:

Fuzzy with precision class from 8 - it will return values that match the query
with the selected number (class) of characters difference (missing, extra,
replaced).
Example: Fuzzy with precision class 2 means two characters can differ from
the query value
We can also sort the results of this action to put the most matching ones in

The ordering value that needs to be pasted depends on the structure in DB

A role is a necessary action by a public institution for a registration to be processed.
There are 2 types of roles
●​Human role: a person will review the file, add some information (example: approval date, etc.), and
approve, reject or send back the file. There are various types of human roles: example, review role
and processing role.
●​BOT role: an automatic processing role performed by a BOT in the system. A bot can be applied to a
field or used in a role to exchange data between eRegistrations and an external database.

●​ Define the flow of the applicant file in the processing part
●​ Send messages and alerts at various stages of processing
●​ Use for statistics
There are 4 basic statuses:
0 = Pending
1 = approved by the role / successfully passed the role
2 = sent back for correction
3 = rejected
The last 2 (send back and reject) are not authorized by default, they must be specifically authorized by the
Analyst to allow the Operator to send back or reject an application.
Under statuses 1 and 2, the analyst must indicate under ‘destination role’ who will receive the file: the
applicant or an operator in another role

The functionality of the status
under BOT role is the same as
the status under the Human role
However, the BOT will not have
the right to reject an application

The destination role has to be
assigned under statuses 1 and 2

By activating status 2 by the
Analyst, it allows the Operator to
send an application back for
correction.

2.1 Polling BOT

We are able to configure a BOT role so that the BOT is querying the
database periodically for a set amount of time.If the data we are searching
for will not appear within the set amount of time, the bot will fail. If it will
appear before the time expires, the bot rolle will be successful and the file
will be sent to the next role in the flow.
The whole feature is explained in detail in this Tutorial.

Selecting BOT type will reveal
few fields including a toggle
named by default“roles repeat
until successful”. Please note the
name is subjected to translation
and may differ if translation was
applied

Switching the toggle on will
reveal two sections in which time
values can be specified

In first section we can set how
often the bot role is going to send
a query to the database
In the second section we can set
how long the BOT should stay
active before it fails.
In this example the interval was
set to one hour which means the
bot will send a query to the
database every hour for 24 hours
(duration - one day)
The duration was set to one day
which means that if within one
day the value we are querying for

the value of your catalog item
and second, which will be the

You can also select a catalog
field in GDB (instead of two
separate columns). In this case
you will refer to the same field in
both cases. You will just have to
select the field property value
when assigning catalog value
and key when assigning the key.

In case we are creating GDB based catalog, the values are not being read

created this way. But they will be visible in DS after the service is published.

This is the structure of exemplary
file to be imported

Structure explanation:

First column is the value that is going to be imported to the catalog.
Second column is the level to which the value belongs to. On the screen
shot we see only level 1 which will be the main catalog values and level 2
which will be subcatalog values for main value “Damascus” and “Damascus
Countryside”
Third column is the name of the parent catalog. It is important to provide it
for every value that is not level one value. It has to be the same as one of
the 1 level values.
Fourth column is the English translation.
Fifth and sixth columns are empty in this example, because in the instance
that I am importing to, there are two more languages active between
English and Arabic, for which I don't have translations ready.

Last column is the arabic translation

Groups
Groups are created in catalogs
when there are many items in the
catalog. Groups are created to

A processing page is the 2nd screen of the operator’s role. This is where the operator is able to see the file
(data and documents) and to review and process it (i.e input some data and approve, reject or send back
for corrections).
The top part of the processing page displays the application details and the application history

b) Processing role
Processing tab is the form (action)
developed by the analyst under Processing
Roles of the BPA.

Depending on the input decided by the
analyst in BPA (data, documents), the
operator can generate the action (i.e
display and/or upload certificate to the user
file)

This is also where the operator validates,
rejects or sends back the application for
correction. To enable the operator to reject
or send back for correction, the analyst in
the BPA has to authorize those actions (in

III. Generic Database System
( GDB, https://gdbs.test.bhutan.eregistrations.org/)
GDB is a system to create and administer a professional database easily, without programming.
In addition, databases created with GDB can exchange data electronically with eRegistrations (without
programming) and any other external system/database, through Web services.
GDB is composed of a public part (where we see the databases created and their content) and an admin
part to create or modify the structure of the databases

A. Public part
This is the public page of the GDB site. By default, the first database in the list is displayed on the screen. It
also displays certain features of the admin part which are visible only to authorized users.

This is the header bar

It consists of:

Update

Used to update a single entry in a database. If applied to an edit grid, it will push a new
entry to EditGrid without removing previous entries. Returns the updated object

Listen

Used to control the flow in the service if some information from an external source is
required for the flow to continue.
A “listener” BOT waits for data until it is sent from an external database or system. When
the data is sent, the listener BOT gets activated and it changes the file status in a given
role.
Example:
1.​ eRegistrations sends data to an external agency.
2.​ the agency reviews the data and issues a certificate, in its own system (this
process takes 4 hours);
3.​ a web service developed by the agency sends the certificate to eRegistrations;
4.​ the listener BOT receives the certificate.
Contrary to a “read” BOTs, which will time out and fail if the data can’t be read
immediately, a listener BOT can wait until the data is available in the external system.
Before creating a listener BOT, the analyst must ask the development team to create in
Mule a web service which will bring the data from the external system.

A listener BOT must be used in a role. Once a file reaches this role it will wait until the
external agency will send the required data to the listener BOT, and only then the file will
change its status.

Update-entries

Used to update multiple sets of data in a database. It will retrieve all entries that meet the
query conditions and update them

Exists

Used to check if an entry exists in a database. It returns boolean value

Delete

Used to delete an entry from the database.

GDB supports saving multiple files in a
file type field.
1.​ Open the DB structure window in
a given database, add a file field
and open this field advance
settings.
In Base settings tab activate
Multiple toggle, click OK and
publish the database.

Requirements in BPA are set to multiple
by default so nothing more needs to be
done if a requirement may consist of
many files.
For additional upload component which
is not a requirement, you need to open
the edit modal, go to Data tab, activate
advanced options and activate Multiple
Values toggle
Please note: The structures have to be
equal so file component with Multiple
Values toggle switch on has to be
mapped to Multiple file field in GDB

just import it from CAS/KC, by clicking on
the icon next to the search field.
Enter the user ID and select the user. The
user is now authorized in GDB.
The next step is to define rights for this
user.

Right side: rights
If a user is selected he can be granted
certain rights to
(1) perform actions
(2) on specific resources in GDB
The resources are the databases
available in the GDB instance. They are
listed in the first column (this column is
titled “resources”)
The possible actions are defined in the
other columns:
●​ Read
●​ Create
●​ Update
●​ Publish
●​ Delete
●​ User rights
The toggles allow the administrator to
define, for each database, the actions a
user has the right to perform.
Examples will be provided below.

Groups of databases
When databases have been grouped in
the database control panel (Grouping
databases), they are listed under their
group in the user right page.

The Date field lets you specify the period of time you want to obtain data
about.
After clicking it, a calendar will appear in which you can specify the period
of your interest. All the other filters always refer to the period selected
here.

Service filter enables you to see data limited only to the selected service

Registration filter enables you to further limit the response to the roles in
this selected registration. For this filter to work, the Service filter has to be
already selected.
Status filter lest you to check how many files had a selected status in a
given role
Thanks to this filter, we can present data broken down into days, weeks,
months or years. This can significantly improve the readability of the
presented data

There is an option to export the current result to an excel or PDF file. To do that just click on the

Certificates issued tab purpose is to provide information about the number of certificates that were
generated for a given service within some period of time.

a) Certificates issued filter
Some of the filters are the same for multiple tabs like Service filter or Date field filter and they were already
described above. Therefore only new filters, specific to the tab in question will be described.
Certificates filter enables you to see data limited only to the selected
certificate. If the certificate was used in more than one service, this filter
will list them all.
To be explained when it will be possible to actually test it.

3. Operators
The purpose of the Operators tab is to provide information on specific operator activity. It provides
information about the number of files that have been processed by the operator through a given role,
broken down into the statuses in which the files were terminated in that role
The statuses are:
●​ Processed
●​ Approved
●​ Sent back
●​ Rejected
The sum of approved, sent back and rejected files will always be equal to files processed.

An Operator filter is used to limit the search to a selected operator. This is
an input field which means the user needs to type the required operator
name into it. As soon as the typing starts the field will provide suggestions.
Roles filter allows you to limit the view to operators who processed the file
in the selected role
