## GDB description

GDB is a system to create and administer a professional database easily, without programming. Databases created with GDB can exchange data electronically with eRegistrations and any other external system through Web services.

---

## Public and admin parts

GDB is composed of a public part (where we see the databases created and their content) and an admin part.

---

## Header bar components

The header bar consists of: Hamburger button (displays list of databases, 'create new database' and 'create new group' buttons), Name of database currently displayed, Status button (version and last updated date), Language, Logged in user.


---

## Sub menu and record controls

The sub menu displays the name of the database. The 'add record' button and edit/delete icons are visible only to authorized users.


---

## Minor UI changes


The GDB public interface may have minor visual updates (styling, spacing, icons) but the overall structure and functionality remain the same.
