# A. Public part

!!! info "Update Summary (1 changes detected)"
    1 change detected: GDB public interface may have minor UI updates but the core structure (header bar, hamburger menu, database list, status button, add record button) is largely stable.

## GDB description

GDB is a system to create and administer a professional database easily, without programming. Databases created with GDB can exchange data electronically with eRegistrations and any other external system through Web services.

---

## Public and admin parts

GDB is composed of a public part (where we see the databases created and their content) and an admin part.

---

## Header bar components

The header bar consists of: Hamburger button (displays list of databases, 'create new database' and 'create new group' buttons), Name of database currently displayed, Status button (version and last updated date), Language, Logged in user.

## Sub menu and record controls

The sub menu displays the name of the database. The 'add record' button and edit/delete icons are visible only to authorized users.

## Minor UI changes

!!! question "Needs Verification"
    GDB is a mature and stable system. While the platform has had many updates, the GDB public interface tends to receive fewer visual changes compared to the DS. However, given the time elapsed since the manual was written, minor visual differences in styling or icons are possible. A visual comparison of the current GDB interface against the manual screenshots is recommended.

The GDB public interface may have minor visual updates (styling, spacing, icons) but the overall structure and functionality remain the same.
