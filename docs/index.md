# eRegistrations User Manual

Welcome to the official **eRegistrations platform user manual**. This manual documents how the eRegistrations no-code platform works — covering the configuration, deployment, and management of electronic government services.

## What is eRegistrations?

eRegistrations is a no-code platform that allows government institutions to digitize their administrative procedures. It enables applicants to apply online for licenses, permits, registrations, certificates, and other authorizations — while providing operators with tools to process, review, and approve those applications.

The platform consists of four main components:

-   :material-cog:{ .lg .middle } **Part I — Administrative Site (BPA)**

    ---

    The back-office configuration tool where analysts design services, forms, workflows, and business rules.

    The public-facing website where applicants fill forms, upload documents, pay fees, and track their applications.

    A flexible database system for managing structured data independently from the service workflow.
