## Processing pages overview

Processing pages are what operators of the institutions which offer registrations in a service see. As a super administrator, you can access the operators' processing pages from the display system (through Part B).

---

## 1. The file list page - Status filters


The list of files filtered by status (pending, approved, rejected, sent back for corrections) is displayed. The drop down list displays all services. Select the service, then select the role from the first dropdown. Calendar icon allows viewing applications submitted at a certain day/time range. The first screen displays all pending files by default.


---

## File list sub menu

Sub menu: Status of file, Business name, Date of receipt, status of registrations, operator in charge. Status filter on bottom corner with different colors. Other filters: all files, validated, sent back, rejected.


---

## 2. The processing page - Application details and history

This is the 2nd screen of the operator's role. The top part displays application details (zip folder of documents) and application history.


---

## a) Revision role

Revision role: Requires operator to verify documents and data. If operator chooses 'NO' under documents revision, field appears for rejection reason. Documents revision tab shows uploaded documents on left, data and requirements on right. Data revision tab displays all components.


---

## b) Processing role

Processing role: Form/action developed by analyst. Operator can generate action (display/upload certificate). Validate, reject, or send back the application. Documents tab shows uploaded documents and certificates. Data tab shows all BPA application file components.


---

## Part B system actions


Part B may now include system action buttons that can be enabled via BPA service settings. These buttons allow operators to perform additional system-level actions during processing, such as triggering BOTs, generating documents, or executing automated workflows directly from the processing page.


---

## E-signature verification in processing


Operators may now be able to verify e-signatures on submitted applications during the processing stage. If applicants use e-signature on the Send page, operators should be able to see and verify the signature status.

---

## Effects system in processing


The effects system may influence operator processing by automatically triggering actions based on operator decisions. For example, when an operator approves or rejects a file, effects may automatically trigger BOTs, send notifications, or update database records.

---

## 3. Clearing old files from the service

The section on clearing old files from the service describes the process for removing outdated application files.
