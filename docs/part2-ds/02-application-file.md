## Shopping cart as alternative to Guide

!!! question "Needs Verification"
    The shopping cart was already mentioned in the July 2025 manual as an alternative to the Guide. However, its exact current state, visual appearance, and behavior may have evolved. The shopping cart toggle exists in BPA service settings. Whether the shopping cart has gained new functionality (such as better registration selection, improved summary display, or integration with new payment features) needs verification. The existing description may be accurate but the visual presentation likely changed with UI theme updates.

Shopping cart: Alternative to the Guide, improved version. Shows summary of registrations, how much to pay and what documents to upload. Accessible on all pages. The shopping cart is enabled via a toggle in service settings and replaces the Guide page for services that use it.

## 5. Send page - E-signature

!!! question "Needs Verification"
    E-signature is a known new platform feature. The Send page (declaration and signature page) is the natural location for e-signature functionality in the applicant workflow. The BPA side has an 'I Swear' component for the Send page, and e-signature may extend or complement this. However, the exact implementation -- whether e-signature is an additional step, replaces the 'I Swear' checkbox, or is optional -- needs verification on the current platform. This is a significant potential addition to the Send page.

The confirmation page usually consists of a set of terms and conditions that the applicant needs to abide by. The Send page may now include e-signature functionality, allowing applicants to digitally sign their application before submission.

## UI theme changes across application file pages

!!! question "Needs Verification"
    The DS has likely undergone visual theme updates since July 2025. The BPA service settings include a 'UI theme' option. All screenshots of application file pages should be verified against the current platform to determine if visual updates are needed. The functional behavior is likely the same, but the visual presentation may differ.

All application file pages (Guide, Form, Documents, Payment, Send) may have received visual updates as part of DS UI theme changes.
