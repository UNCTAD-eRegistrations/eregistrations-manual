## Guide purpose

Questions can be created in the guide to help determine, for each specific user, which documents, fees and data are required.

---

## Guide three elements

The guide is defined by three elements: Description (name of the guide question), Form (where guide questions are developed and linked to the requirements and/or application form using determinants), Status.


---

## Guide toggle activation

If your service has a Guide, activate the guide toggle.


---

## Creating guide questions

To create a question in the Guide, click on the 'Guide' tab in the Application File. Under the 'Form' tab, create questions using the form components that will filter the data, requirements and fees for specific users' case.


---

## Shopping cart alternative


Alternative to the guide: the shopping cart. The shopping cart allows applicants to select registrations directly rather than answering filtering questions. It may have been enhanced with additional features such as registration previews, cost summaries, or document requirement displays.


---

## Potential new guide features


The guide may have gained new capabilities such as conditional branching improvements, integration with the effects/behaviours system for dynamic form behavior, or enhanced determinant support. The component behaviours system (visible in the API) may apply to guide components.
