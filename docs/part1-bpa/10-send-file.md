## Declaration and signature page description

This is the declaration and signature page. It can be developed the same way you develop the form.

---

## I Swear custom component

The declaration can be created using the 'I Swear' component under Custom Components tab.

---

## E-signature feature on Send page


The Send page now supports e-signature functionality, allowing applicants to digitally sign their application before submission. This feature must be enabled and configured at the service level. When enabled, a signature component appears on the Send page where applicants can apply their electronic signature to the declaration.

Note: The exact configuration steps, supported signature types, and any prerequisites for enabling e-signature should be documented based on the current platform implementation.

<!-- Screenshot needed: New screenshots needed: (1) The e-signature component on the Send page as seen in the BPA form builder, (2) The e-signature interface as seen by the applicant on the public site, (3) Any e-signature configuration options in the component properties or service settings. -->

## E-signature configuration details


The specific configuration steps for e-signature on the Send page need to be documented. This includes: how to enable e-signature for a service, what component or toggle activates it, what signature providers are supported, and what the applicant experience looks like.
