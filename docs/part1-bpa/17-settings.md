!!! info "Update Summary (7 changes detected)"
    The Settings section structure (Instance Settings and Service Settings) remains valid.
    Core items like logo, language, currencies, footer messages, translations, and logout are still present.
    However, the settings area has likely expanded with new toggles and configuration options added since July 2025 (e.g., e-signature settings, micro-publish options, form version controls, new display system toggles).
    Individual setting items need verification against the current platform state.

## Instance Settings - Logo

The instance logo can be configured in the Settings area. This allows administrators to upload or change the logo displayed on the public site.

---

## Instance Settings - Language and Currencies

Language and currency settings allow administrators to configure the default language and available currencies for the instance.

---

## Instance Settings - Footer Messages

Footer messages can be configured to display custom text at the bottom of the public site pages.

---

## Instance Settings - Display System Options

!!! question "Needs Verification — [Verify in BPA](https://bpa.cuba.eregistrations.org/settings){ target=_blank }"
    New display system toggles may have been added since July 2025. The exact list of current toggles should be verified against the live platform to determine if new options need to be documented.

Display system options control various aspects of how the public site behaves and appears. The original manual documents the toggles available as of July 2025.

<!-- Screenshot needed: Screenshot of the display system options panel -- needs to be recaptured if new toggles have been added. -->

---

## Translations

The Translations section allows administrators to manage text translations for the platform interface and service content.

---

## Log out

The Log out option is available in the Settings area to end the current administrator session.

---

## Service Settings - Pages/buttons/fields

Service-level settings include configuration of pages, buttons, and fields that control the service behavior and appearance.

---

## Service Settings - Service Options toggles

!!! question "Needs Verification — [Verify in BPA](https://bpa.cuba.eregistrations.org/settings){ target=_blank }"
    New service option toggles may have been added since July 2025 (e.g., e-signature enable/disable, micro-publish settings, form version options). The current list of available toggles should be verified against the live platform.

Service Options provides toggles that control service-level behavior. The original manual documents the toggles available as of July 2025.

<!-- Screenshot needed: Screenshot of the Service Options panel -- needs to be recaptured to show any new toggles. -->

---

## Service Settings - Publish History

Publish history shows a log of when the service was published and by whom.

---

## Service Settings - Export Service

The Export service feature allows administrators to export the service configuration.

---

## Service Settings - Databases

The Databases section in service settings provides access to database-related configuration.

---

## Potential new settings sections or categories

!!! question "Needs Verification — [Verify in BPA](https://bpa.cuba.eregistrations.org/settings){ target=_blank }"
    The settings area may contain entirely new sections or categories not documented in the July 2025 manual. A comprehensive review of the current settings interface is recommended to identify any new top-level items.

New settings sections or categories may have been added to either Instance Settings or Service Settings since July 2025.

---

## E-signature related settings

!!! question "Needs Verification — [Verify in BPA](https://bpa.cuba.eregistrations.org/settings){ target=_blank }"
    Since e-signature is a significant new feature, there are likely associated settings that need to be documented. The exact location and nature of these settings should be verified against the platform.

E-signature functionality may require new settings at either the instance or service level for configuration of signature providers, certificate authorities, or signature appearance options.

---

## Micro-publish related settings

!!! question "Needs Verification — [Verify in BPA](https://bpa.cuba.eregistrations.org/settings){ target=_blank }"
    If micro-publish is a newer capability, it may have added settings or toggles in the service settings area. This should be verified against the platform.

Micro-publish functionality may have introduced new settings or modified existing publish-related settings.
