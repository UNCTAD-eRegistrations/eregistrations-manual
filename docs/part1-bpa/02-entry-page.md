## BPA entry page structure - 3 sections

![BPA Entry Page](./screenshots/bpa-services-list.png)
*The BPA entry page showing the three main sections: header/instance bar (top), side menu (left), and workspace (center).*

The BPA entry page has 3 main sections:
- 'Header' also called 'instance bar' (the blue bar at the top)
- Side menu (on the left)
- Work space (in grey)

<!-- Verify screenshot: BPA entry page overview - verify the layout is visually the same, though individual elements within each section may have changed. -->

## Instance bar - UNCTAD logo and FE/BE/DS buttons

It consists sequentially of:
- UNCTAD and eRegistrations logo
- 3 buttons FE (front end), BE (back end) and DS (display system). When they are red, it means the corresponding component is getting updated. We can work on the system only when all buttons are green. When you put the cursor over the components name you will see the version number currently running. Versioning is made according to semantic versioning rules.

<!-- Verify screenshot: FE/BE/DS status buttons - verify visual appearance and tooltip content are unchanged. -->

## Instance bar - Logged users and auto-update toggle

'Logged users' show the number of administrators logged into BPA at that moment.
When the toggle is switched on, new feature/bug fixes are allowed to come automatically to the applications in the system.

<!-- Verify screenshot: Logged users counter and auto-update toggle - verify visual appearance. -->

## Instance bar - User level toggle

User level 1 and 2 is a toggle button that minimizes and expands display of elements on the side menu bar.

<!-- Verify screenshot: User level toggle - verify it still functions as a 1/2 toggle. -->

---

## Instance bar - User ID, language, settings

- User ID of the administrator logged in
- Choice of language
- Instance settings icon: 1. Settings that will apply to all services, 2. Translations icon, 3. Log-out icon

<!-- Verify screenshot: User ID, language, and instance settings - verify layout and options. -->

## Instance bar - potential additional elements


The instance bar may contain additional elements not present in the July 2025 manual, such as notification indicators, environment labels (dev/staging/production), or audit/history shortcuts.
