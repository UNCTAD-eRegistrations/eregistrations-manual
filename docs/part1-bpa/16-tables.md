## Tables overview and three types

Tables is a list of catalogs in the system. Three types: 1. Service catalogs (or simply tables) - group all elements created in services, 2. Cross-tables - see elements linked to each registration, 3. Instance catalogs - catalogs used by all services in one instance.

---

## 1. Tables/Service catalogs

Service catalogs group by nature all elements created in services (data fields, fees, documents, institutions, units, determinants, questions, etc.). The number within brackets indicates the number of elements available.

---

## 2. Cross-tables

Cross-tables show elements linked to each registration (data/registrations, documents/registrations, fees/registrations, roles/registration, etc.).

---

## 3. Instance catalogs

Catalogs used by all services in one instance (list of countries, cities, company types, economic activities, etc.). Includes: a) How to create a catalog (BPA instance catalog with add/create, add values up to 500 characters, subcatalogs, GDB-based catalogs), b) How to import a catalog with subcatalogs and/or multiple translations (upload items modal with template download, XLS format with level, parent, and language columns), Groups (segregate catalog items into categories, usable as determinants), c) Document rejection reasons (for revision role).

---

## Classification system

Tables in eRegistrations are backed by a classification system that organizes catalog data (dropdown options, reference lists, etc.) into reusable structures. Classifications can be created, updated, exported as CSV, and shared across services.

---

## Catalog import/export improvements


The catalog import/export functionality may have received improvements since the manual was written, including CSV export capability and additional import formats.


---

## GDB-based catalog enhancements


GDB-based catalogs (catalogs populated from GDB data) may have received improvements in how they reference databases, handle versioning, or display values.
