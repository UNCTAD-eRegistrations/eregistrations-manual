  "change_summary": "Entirely new section. E-signature functionality allows applicants to digitally sign documents or the application itself. The original manual describes the Send file page (section D.6) as the 'declaration and signature page' with an 'I Swear' custom component, but does not mention digital or electronic signatures. E-signature likely extends the Send page with actual digital signing capability. It may involve integration with external e-signature providers, new custom components, or configuration in service settings. No direct MCP tool endpoints for e-signature were found, suggesting it may be implemented as a form component configuration or external integration. 7 blocks identified, all needing verification due to limited concrete information.",

      "content": "E-signature functionality allows applicants to digitally sign documents or the application itself within the eRegistrations platform. This provides legal validity to the submission and may replace or supplement the traditional 'I Swear' declaration component.\n\nE-signature may be implemented as:\n- A new custom component in the form builder that can be placed on the Send page or other pages.\n- An enhancement to the existing Send file page workflow.\n- An integration with external e-signature providers (e.g., DocuSign, Adobe Sign, or government-provided e-signature infrastructure).\n\nThe specific implementation approach needs verification.",

      "explanation": "The original manual's Send file section (D.6) mentions the 'I Swear' component for declaration and signature but does not describe electronic or digital signature capabilities. E-signature is identified as a new feature in the manual update plan. No MCP tool endpoints specific to e-signature were found in the available tools, suggesting it may be implemented at the form component or service configuration level.",

      "content": "To configure e-signature for a service, the analyst likely needs to:\n1. Enable e-signature at the service level (possibly through service settings).\n2. Add an e-signature component to the appropriate form page (likely the Send page).\n3. Configure which documents or forms require a signature.\n4. Set up the e-signature provider integration (if using an external provider).\n5. Configure the signature validation rules and appearance.\n\nThe exact configuration steps and UI location need verification.",

      "content": "E-signature may be available as a new custom component in the form builder, similar to the existing 'I Swear' component and 'QR code' component found in the Custom Components tab.\n\nThe e-signature component would likely allow:\n- Capturing a digital signature (drawn, typed, or uploaded).\n- Linking the signature to specific form data or documents.\n- Displaying a signature verification indicator.\n\nThe component may have its own configuration options for signature type, appearance, and validation.",

      "explanation": "The original manual documents several custom components (I Swear, QR code, Payment Providers) but does not mention an e-signature component.
