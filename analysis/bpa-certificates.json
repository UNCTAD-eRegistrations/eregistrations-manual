The Print Page A4 styling system is already documented in D.8 Custom classes. The MCP tools reveal a 'print document' system (print_document_list, print_document_create, print_document_component_add/update/remove/move, print_document_sort, print_document_templates, print_document_history, print_document_revert) which may represent a newer or additional certificate management approach. E-signature on certificates needs verification.",
