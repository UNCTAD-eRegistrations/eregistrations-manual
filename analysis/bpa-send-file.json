  "change_summary": "The Send File section has the most significant gap of the sections analyzed. The original content correctly describes the declaration and signature page as a customizable form page using the 'I Swear' custom component. This base functionality is unchanged. However, the e-signature feature is a major addition to the Send page that is entirely absent from the July 2025 manual. A new subsection documenting e-signature configuration and behavior on the Send page is needed.",

      "explanation": "E-signature is a significant new feature added to the eRegistrations platform after the July 2025 manual was written.
