  "change_summary": "Entirely new section. The Effects system is a newer addition to eRegistrations that extends the Determinants functionality. It allows analysts to define conditional behaviors on form components such as show/hide, enable/disable, activate/deactivate, and set values. Effects link one or more determinants to a component using AND/OR logic. The system is managed through component behaviours, where each behaviour can contain multiple effects. MCP tool signatures confirm the existence of effect_create, effect_delete, componentbehaviour_list, componentbehaviour_get, and componentbehaviour_get_by_component endpoints. 8 blocks identified, all new or needing verification.",

      "title": "Overview of the Effects System",
      "content": "The Effects system is an extension of the Determinants functionality in eRegistrations. While determinants define conditions based on field values (e.g., 'if field X equals Y'), Effects define what happens to a component when those conditions are met. Effects provide more granular control over component behavior than the basic determinant show/hide mechanism described in the Determinants section.\n\nEffects work through a layered structure:\n- A form component can have a 'component behaviour' attached to it.\n- Each component behaviour can contain one or more 'effects'.\n- Each effect links one or more determinants to the component and specifies what should happen when the determinant conditions are met.",
      "original_content": null,
      "explanation": "This is an entirely new feature not present in the original manual. The original manual documents determinants (section D.2) and their basic show/hide functionality, but does not cover the Effects system which provides a more structured and powerful approach to conditional component behavior. The MCP tool definitions confirm the existence of componentbehaviour_list, componentbehaviour_get, componentbehaviour_get_by_component, effect_create, and effect_delete operations.",

      "title": "Effect Types",
      "content": "The following effect types are available when creating an effect:\n- activate: Activates a component when the determinant conditions are met.\n- deactivate: Deactivates a component when the determinant conditions are met.\n- show: Makes a component visible when the determinant conditions are met.\n- hide: Hides a component when the determinant conditions are met.\n- enable: Enables a component (makes it editable) when the determinant conditions are met.\n- disable: Disables a component (makes it read-only) when the determinant conditions are met.\n\nEach effect also has an effect_value (a boolean) that determines the polarity of the effect.",
      "original_content": null,
      "explanation": "The effect types are confirmed by the MCP tool definition for effect_create, which lists the valid effect_type values as: activate, deactivate, show, hide, enable, disable. The default effect_type is 'activate' and the default effect_value is True. This provides significantly more options than the basic show/hide behavior documented for determinants in the current manual.",

      "title": "Creating an Effect",
      "content": "To create an effect on a form component:\n1. Identify the service and the target form component (by its component key).\n2. Select one or more determinants that will serve as the conditions for the effect.\n3. Choose the logic for combining multiple determinants: 'AND' (all determinants must match) or 'OR' (any determinant must match). The default is 'AND'.\n4. Select the effect type (activate, deactivate, show, hide, enable, or disable). The default is 'activate'.\n5. Set the effect value (true or false). The default is true.\n6. Save the effect.\n\nWhen an effect is created, the system generates a behaviour record for the component (if one does not already exist) and attaches the effect to it. The system returns a behaviour_id, effect_id, and an audit_id for tracking the change.",
      "original_content": null,
      "explanation": "The creation workflow is derived from the MCP tool definition for effect_create, which requires: service_id, component_key, determinant_ids (at least one), and optionally logic (AND/OR), effect_type, and effect_value. The response includes behaviour_id, effect_id, component_key, determinant_count, effect_type, effect_value, logic, service_id, and audit_id. The exact BPA UI for this workflow needs verification.",

      "title": "Determinant Logic: AND vs OR",
      "content": "When an effect references multiple determinants, the logic parameter determines how they are combined:\n- AND logic: All referenced determinants must have their conditions met for the effect to trigger. This is the default.\n- OR logic: The effect triggers if any one of the referenced determinants has its condition met.\n\nThis allows for complex conditional behaviors. For example, you could create an effect that shows a field only when both the applicant type is 'company' AND the registration type is 'new registration' (AND logic), or create an effect that disables a field when either the application is in 'draft' status OR the user has selected 'not applicable' (OR logic).",
      "original_content": null,
      "explanation": "The AND/OR logic is confirmed by the MCP tool definition for effect_create which includes a 'logic' parameter with values 'AND' or 'OR', defaulting to 'AND'. The current manual's Determinants section mentions combining determinants with AND/OR operators for registration determinants, but the Effects system formalizes this with a dedicated parameter.",

Each form component can have at most one behaviour record, but that behaviour can contain multiple effects.\n\nA component behaviour includes:\n- A unique behaviour ID.\n- The component key identifying which form component it applies to.\n- The service ID.\n- A list of effects, each containing its own determinants and property effects.\n\nYou can list all component behaviours for a service to see which components have effects configured, along with the effect count for each. You can also retrieve the behaviour for a specific component by its key.",

      "explanation": "The delete operation is confirmed by the MCP tool definition for effect_delete, which takes a behaviour_id and returns deleted (bool), behaviour_id, deleted_behaviour, and audit_id.

Determinants define conditions based on field values, while Effects define what happens when those conditions are met. The Effects system uses JSONLogic internally for determinant evaluation.\n\nIt is likely that the existing determinant show/hide behavior described in section D.2 coexists with the newer Effects system. The original determinant-based show/hide may still work for simple cases, while the Effects system provides more advanced options. The exact relationship and whether the Effects system supersedes or complements the older approach needs to be verified.",
      "original_content": null,
      "explanation": "The componentbehaviour_get tool returns effects with 'parsed JSONLogic determinants', confirming that Effects use JSONLogic internally. The relationship between the basic determinant show/hide in section D.2 and the Effects system needs clarification. It is possible that the Effects system is the underlying mechanism for determinants, or that they are parallel systems. A human reviewer should verify this on the live platform.",

      "original_content": null,
      "explanation": "The MCP tools provide API-level access to effects but do not describe the BPA user interface.
