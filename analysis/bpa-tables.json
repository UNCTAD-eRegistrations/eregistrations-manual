Catalog creation, subcatalogs, GDB-based catalogs, import/export with templates, groups, and document rejection reasons are all accurately documented. The MCP tools reveal a 'classification' system (classification_list, classification_create, classification_update, classification_delete, classification_export_csv, classification_apply_country_codes) that may relate to or extend the catalog system. Import/export may have improvements.",
