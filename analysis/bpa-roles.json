Part B system actions are already referenced in the manual text. Role creation has additional fields confirmed via MCP (allow_to_confirm_payments, allow_access_to_financial_reports). Polling BOT is unchanged. Revision role with field-by-field verification is unchanged. The Effects system is a new platform feature that interacts with role form components. E-signature integration in roles needs verification. New role type options or permissions may exist.",
