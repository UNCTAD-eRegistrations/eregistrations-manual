## 1. Guide
**UNCHANGED**

> Answers provided in the Guide will help determine, for each specific user, which documents, fees and data are required.

**Screenshot:** Verify -- Guide page in DS, check current visual appearance.

## Shopping cart as alternative to Guide
**VERIFY**

**Original:**
> Shopping cart: Alternative to the Guide, improved version. Shows summary of registrations, how much to pay and what documents to upload. Accessible on all pages.

**Current assessment:**
> The shopping cart was already documented in the July 2025 manual. Its exact current state, visual appearance, and behavior may have evolved. The shopping cart toggle exists in BPA service settings. Whether it has gained new functionality needs verification.

**Needs verification:** The existing description may be accurate but the visual presentation likely changed with UI theme updates. Functionality enhancements (improved registration selection, summary display, payment integration) should be checked.

## 2. Applicant form
**UNCHANGED**

> This is where the applicant provides all the relevant data that pertains to his objective.

**Screenshot:** Verify -- applicant form page in DS, check current visual appearance.

## 3. Documents
**UNCHANGED**

> This is the documents upload page. This tab will appear only if documents need to be uploaded.

## 4. Payment
**UNCHANGED**

> Payment tab will appear only if there is a payment in the process.

**Screenshot:** Verify -- payment page in DS.

## 5. Send page - E-signature
**VERIFY**

**Original:**
> The confirmation page usually consists of a set of terms and conditions that the applicant needs to abide by.

**Current assessment:**
> The Send page may now include e-signature functionality, allowing applicants to digitally sign their application before submission.

**Needs verification:** E-signature is a known new platform feature. The Send page (declaration and signature page) is the natural location for e-signature functionality. The BPA has an 'I Swear' component for the Send page. Whether e-signature is an additional step, replaces the checkbox, or is optional needs verification.
**Screenshot:** Needs update -- Send page in DS, verify if e-signature functionality is present.

## UI theme changes across application file pages
**VERIFY**

> All application file pages (Guide, Form, Documents, Payment, Send) may have received visual updates as part of DS UI theme changes.

**Needs verification:** The DS has likely undergone visual theme updates since July 2025. The BPA service settings include a 'UI theme' option. All screenshots should be verified against the current platform.
**Screenshot:** Needs update -- all application file page screenshots should be compared against current platform appearance.
