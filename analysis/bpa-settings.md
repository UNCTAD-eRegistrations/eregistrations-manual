# I. Settings (p.133-137)

**Change Summary:** The Settings section structure (Instance Settings and Service Settings) remains valid. Core items like logo, language, currencies, footer messages, translations, and logout are still present. However, the settings area has likely expanded with new toggles and configuration options added since July 2025 (e.g., e-signature settings, micro-publish options, form version controls, new display system toggles). Individual setting items need verification against the current platform state.
