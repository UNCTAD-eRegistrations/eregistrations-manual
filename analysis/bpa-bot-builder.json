  "change_summary": "6 items identified: BOT type definitions and creation workflows are largely unchanged. Data BOT categories have expanded beyond just 'Create' to include read, update, list, exist, log, and other (confirmed via MCP tool muleservice_discover). The concurrent BOT execution toggle and system action restrictions are already documented in the manual. Mapping transformations list is comprehensive and likely unchanged. The Part B system actions concept is mentioned in the manual text. New BOT categories and potential mapping UI improvements need verification.",
