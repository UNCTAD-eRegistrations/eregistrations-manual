# Introduction (p.5)

**Change Summary:** The introduction remains largely accurate. The core description of eRegistrations as a no-code platform and the basic applicant-operator-certificate flow are unchanged. The terminology (public site, DS, BPA) is still current. Minor additions could mention newer capabilities (e-signature, advanced workflows) but the introduction is intentionally high-level and does not require significant revision.

**Changes Found:** 1 (verify item)

## [UNCHANGED] Manual purpose statement

> The purpose of this user manual is to provide an overview of the main functions and features of the eRegistrations system and to explain how to create online services.

The stated purpose of the manual remains accurate and does not require any changes.

---

## [UNCHANGED] No-code platform description

> eRegistrations is a no-code development platform allowing to create online services without programming.

The core identity of eRegistrations as a no-code platform has not changed.

---

## [UNCHANGED] Online service flow description

> An online service is a succession of online screens and actions through which:
> - an applicant can fill a form, upload documents, pay and send his request (application file)
> - one or more operators can review the file and approve or reject an application (processing)
> - The applicant data is sent to an online registry
> - A registration certificate is issued

The high-level flow description (form, documents, payment, send, processing, certificate) is still accurate. While newer features like e-signature have been added to certain steps, this summary-level description remains correct as-is.

---

## [UNCHANGED] Public site and administrative site terminology

> Online services are visible on the 'public site', also called 'user site' or 'DS' (Display System). They are created through an 'administrative site', also called 'BPA' (Business Process Analyzer).

The terminology for the public-facing site (DS/Display System) and the administrative backend (BPA/Business Process Analyzer) is still in active use across all deployments.

## [VERIFY] Potential mention of newer platform capabilities

The introduction may benefit from a brief mention of newer platform capabilities such as e-signature support, advanced workflow features, or other significant additions made after July 2025. However, since the introduction is intentionally high-level, this should be verified with stakeholders before adding.

**Needs human verification:** The introduction does not mention e-signature, advanced workflow capabilities, or other features added since July 2025. Since the introduction is meant to be a high-level overview, it may be acceptable as-is, but a subject matter expert should confirm whether any new top-level capabilities warrant mention here.

- **Screenshot status:** Unknown -- if any new high-level platform diagram or overview screenshot exists, it may need to be evaluated for inclusion.
