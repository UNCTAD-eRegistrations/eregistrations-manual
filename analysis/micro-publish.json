  "change_summary": "Entirely new section. Micro-publish allows publishing only specific parts of a service rather than the entire service. This reduces publish time and risk of unintended changes. The original manual describes the publish button on the service bar (section B) as a single full-service publish action. Micro-publish is an enhancement to this workflow. The service settings section (section I) mentions 'Publish history' which likely reflects micro-publish operations. The MCP service_publish tool does not expose micro-publish granularity, suggesting the feature may be UI-only or use different API endpoints. 6 blocks identified, most needing verification.",

      "title": "Overview of Micro-publish",
      "content": "Micro-publish is an enhancement to the service publishing workflow in eRegistrations. Instead of publishing the entire service (all forms, roles, BOTs, certificates, and configuration), micro-publish allows analysts to publish only the specific parts of the service that have changed.\n\nThis provides two key benefits:\n1. Reduced publish time: Publishing only changed components is faster than republishing everything.\n2. Reduced risk: By publishing only specific changes, there is less risk of unintended modifications being pushed to the public interface.\n\nMicro-publish is accessed through the 'publish service' button on the service bar, which now provides options for granular publishing in addition to the traditional full-service publish.",
      "original_content": null,
      "explanation": "The original manual describes publishing as a single action: 'when a service is published, it becomes available on the public interface. Every time a change is made in the BPA that needs to be reflected on the public interface (DS), the service has to be (re)published.' Micro-publish adds granularity to this process. The exact UI needs verification.",

      "title": "Micro-publish Options",
      "content": "When using micro-publish, the analyst can likely select from the following publishable components:\n- Forms (applicant form, guide form, processing role forms)\n- Roles configuration\n- BOT configuration and mappings\n- Certificate/document templates\n- Registration settings (documents, fees, institutions)\n- Service settings and display options\n\nEach component may show an indicator of whether it has unpublished changes, helping the analyst identify what needs to be published.",
      "original_content": null,
      "explanation": "The specific components available for micro-publish are speculative based on the service structure documented in the manual. The actual options presented in the micro-publish UI need to be verified on the live platform. The MCP service_publish tool does not expose micro-publish granularity, suggesting the feature may have its own UI workflow.",

      "title": "Micro-publish Workflow",
      "content": "The micro-publish workflow likely involves:\n1. Click the 'Publish service' button on the service bar.\n2. A dialog or expanded interface appears showing the available publish options.\n3. Select which parts of the service to publish (individual components or groups).\n4. The system may show a preview or summary of what changes will be published.\n5. Confirm the publish action.\n6. The system publishes only the selected components and updates the publish history.\n\nAlternatively, micro-publish may be automatic -- the system may detect what has changed since the last publish and only publish those changes, without requiring manual selection.",
      "original_content": null,
      "explanation": "The exact workflow is not confirmed. It could be a manual selection process or an automatic change-detection-based process. A human reviewer should test the publish workflow on the live BPA to document the exact steps.",

      "content": "The service settings section includes a 'Publish history' tab (documented in section I of the manual). With micro-publish, the publish history likely shows more granular entries, indicating which specific parts of the service were published in each operation rather than just recording a full-service publish.\n\nPublish history entries for micro-publish operations may include:\n- Timestamp of the publish operation\n- Which components were published\n- Who performed the publish\n- Whether it was a full publish or a micro-publish",
      "original_content": null,
      "explanation": "The original manual mentions 'Publish history' as a tab in service settings but does not describe its contents in detail. Micro-publish likely enhanced the publish history to show more granular information. The exact format of publish history entries needs verification.",

      "title": "Full Publish vs Micro-publish",
      "content": "After the introduction of micro-publish, the original full-service publish capability likely still exists as an option. Analysts may be able to choose between:\n- Full publish: Republishes the entire service, as documented in the original manual.\n- Micro-publish: Publishes only selected or changed components.\n\nThe full publish may serve as a 'safety net' when the analyst wants to ensure all changes are synchronized, while micro-publish is the preferred approach for routine updates.",
      "original_content": null,
      "explanation": "It is standard practice to maintain backward compatibility with full publish while adding micro-publish. However, the exact UI presentation of both options needs verification. It is possible that micro-publish replaced the full publish entirely, or that both options are presented side by side.",

      "original_content": null,
      "explanation": "Micro-publish introduces complexity around component dependencies. The system likely has some form of dependency checking, but the exact behavior is unknown. A reviewer should test edge cases like publishing a form that references an unpublished determinant.",
